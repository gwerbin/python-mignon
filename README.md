# Mignon: a **Mi**niature JS**ON**-RPC framework

## What is this?

This is a framework for building a JSON-RPC 2.0 server in Python. It has a small and easy-to-use programming interface in the [sans-io](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) style.

## Why should I use this?

Honestly, you probably shouldn't. Use [json-rpc](https://json-rpc.readthedocs.io/) instead.
